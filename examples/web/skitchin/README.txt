How to create your API Key:
---------------------------

- Login to the Dashboard: https://mgr.brightcontext.com/
- From the Dashboard click API Key Management. 
- Click New.
- If testing from localhost, use a Web type with a domain origin of localhost, otherwise use the domain of your test site.
- Using a text editor open index.html. 
- Find this code: var apikey = '';
- Enter the API key you just created between the quotes. For example: var apikey = 'f5520217-3934-4237-8922-dee702629f86';
- Save your index.html file. 

Note: Due to browser security restrictions, we recommend testing with a web server using http:// or https:// urls to access the demos, opening file:// urls will have mixed results.
